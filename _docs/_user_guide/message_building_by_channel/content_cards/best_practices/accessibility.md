# Building accessible Content Cards in Braze

## Header and body text

Keep your header and body text descriptive, enticing, and short. Test your copy to make sure your text isn’t truncated—this hurts all users. Refer to our [creative specifications]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/creative_details) for Content Cards for more on recommended text length.

## Links

Write link text that clearly describes the action that will happen when a user selects it. Screenreader users often tab from link to link as a way of skimming through content, so make sure your link text can stand on its own. Avoid phrases like "click here," "more," and "click for details," as they are ambiguous when read out of context.

## Images

Some users aren’t able to see the images in your Content Cards. Without considering accessibility, images can become a barrier to all users receiving the same content. 

For images that convey simple information, like a photograph, icon, or logo, describe the image with alternative text (alt text). Alt text is a short description of the content of the image that screenreaders and other assistive technologies provide to their users.

Avoid using images of text, as screenreaders can’t read text that’s contained inside an image. Images of text also don’t resize well, and can’t be customized to the user's needs and preferences. With actual text, users can customize things like color and contrast, and resize the text without losing quality. When images of text are enlarged, they become pixelated and lower quality, making them difficult to read.

## Design

Users should be able to clearly differentiate between interactive and non-interactive cards.
