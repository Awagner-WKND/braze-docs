# Wunderkind

> Wunderkind is a platform that scales eCommerce revenue through high-performing, one-to-one email sends. We analyzed the performance lift for clients who use both Braze and Wunderkind and the data is clear: Wunderkind’s scale and the Braze platform together drive undeniable triggered email performance. 

Wunderkind’s Identification technology is the key differentiator to our scale and value-add to Braze’s ESP product. Our ID advantage enables brands to recognize more anonymous users across devices down to the level of an actionable email address. On average, Wunderkind scales the Identification percentage from 3-5% (pre-Wunderkind) of website traffic to ~40-60%, significantly scaling 1:1 messages sent via Braze and scaling contacts [list growth] added directly to the Braze CRM. 
Our integration results in driving acquisition and scaling retargeting efforts across the Email channel, thus scaling revenue for mutual clients.
